An attempt to recapture the same vibes of early remix, but from first principles, now that generators are more widely understood and adopted, typescript is more widely used, and the ecosystem has more mature libraries for building fullstack apps, a fully functional Effect system is available, tsx can already compile to different targets, web, mobile, native, tui, etc. Fullstack is more of a given now, and the idea of meta frameworks that generate code based on schemas or configurations is more widely accepted. This is an attempt to imagine a framework that can capture that same vibe of remix, but from first principles, effect first, react and ssr and server components and ai generating ui in realtime, events stream, local first, live syncing, crdt etc. this is an end to end solution to all of these core problems, but with a focus on developer experience, performance, and scalability. Easy to host, on any provider, easy to deploy, easy to scale, easy to maintain, easy to extend, easy to customize, easy to integrate with other tools and services, easy to use, easy to learn, easy to love.
