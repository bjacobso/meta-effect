What would datamodeling look like that compiles to prisma or drizzle or convex or sqlite or supabase or whatever?

What would an effect forms library look like to define forms based on a subset of the Schema, like using optics to pick out fields and render react components for them?

What would effectful ai primitives look like in this world? Like a chat completion effect that takes a schema and generates a form based on it, or takes a form submission and validates it against the schema, or takes a schema and generates effects and used as run time reflection engine?

What would a migration system look like that generates migrations based on schema changes, and can be run as an effect?

What would a testing library look like that generates test cases based on the schema, and can be run as an effect?

What would a documentation generator look like that generates docs based on the schema, and can be run as an effect?

Each of these ideas could be expressed as Meta Primitives.

What would a meta primitive look like that takes a schema and generates a CRUD API for it, using effects to handle the database operations? CrudService.make ?

What would a meta primitive look like that takes a schema and generates a GraphQL API for it, using effects to handle the resolvers? (GraphQLApi?)

What would a meta primitive look like that takes a schema and generates a REST API for it, using effects to handle the endpoints? HttpApi (Done)

What would a meta primitive look like that takes a schema and generates a set of React components for it, using effects to handle the state management? FormComponents?

could we have
<FormComponents>
<FormComponents.Form schema={UserSchema} onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
<FormComponents.Input field={UserSchema.fields.name} />
<FormComponents.Select field={UserSchema.fields.role} options={roleOptions} />
<FormComponents.TextArea field={UserSchema.fields.bio} />
<FormComponents.Checkbox field={UserSchema.fields.isActive} />
<FormComponents.RadioGroup field={UserSchema
</FormComponents>
