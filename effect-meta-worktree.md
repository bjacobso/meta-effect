Meta Worktree

it helps you conduct your git worktree business.

What would an ai first meta framework for managing git worktrees look like? like imagine you could build a build system from a prompt:

```
"/new worktree for feature X based on main branch, install dependencies, run tests, and set up pre-commit hooks"

> do you want to branch off main? (y/n)
> y
> creating worktree at ./feature-x based on main...
```
